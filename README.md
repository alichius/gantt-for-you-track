## Overview

- Try it [here and now](https://fschopp.github.io/gantt-for-you-track/).
- Based on:
  - [fschopp/project-planning-ui-for-you-track](https://github.com/fschopp/project-planning-ui-for-you-track) for its user-interface framework and for configuring the connection to YouTrack.
  - [fschopp/project-planning-for-you-track](https://github.com/fschopp/project-planning-ui-for-you-track) for the communication with YouTrack.
  - [fschopp/project-planning-js](https://github.com/fschopp/project-planning-js) for the list-scheduling algorithm used for scheduling the unresolved issues.
  - [adamhaile/S.js](https://github.com/adamhaile/S) and [adamhaile/Surplus](https://github.com/adamhaile/surplus) for reactive programming of the user interface.
  - [dhtmlxGantt](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/) for the Gantt widget.
- Written in TypeScript.
- Partial [API documentation](https://fschopp.github.io/gantt-for-you-track/doc/) available. Generated by TypeDoc.
- [Test coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/fschopp/gantt-for-you-track?branch=master) is currently incomplete. However, the underlying algorithm packages [fschopp/project-planning-js](https://github.com/fschopp/project-planning-js/) and [fschopp/project-planning-for-you-track](https://github.com/fschopp/project-planning-for-you-track/) have complete test coverage.
